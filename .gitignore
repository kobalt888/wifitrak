# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/ruby/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/ruby/db/*.sqlite3
/ruby/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/ruby/log/*
/ruby/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/ruby/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/ruby/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
/tmp/storage/*
!/tmp/storage/
!/tmp/storage/.keep

/ruby/public/assets
